## Description of dataset

The data set is the one I plan to use for my masters thesis.*(They say not to share the dataset with someone else, but I don't think there will be an issue to share with you.)*
It is a cross-sectional survey data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for Turkey from the year 2018, which is a representative household  survey providing detailed information on birth recodes and individual records for women of each household for developing countries. 

The potential questions I am interested in exploring are:

-   Effect of childbirth on female labor force participation

-   Effect of living conditions on early childhood development

-   And additional ones I might discover along the way
